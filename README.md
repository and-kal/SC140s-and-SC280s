Tweetable SuperCollider code was popular for some time and I still love it. 
These snippets are called "SC140" - small SuperCollider patches with 140 characters or less. 
You can find a lot of them through the [@sc140tweets](https://twitter.com/sc140tweets) account on Twitter still. Back in 2009, UK's the Wire magazine even did a compilation album with SC140s; the source code of its contributions can be found [here](https://ia800202.us.archive.org/29/items/sc140/sc140_sourcecode.txt).

SC280s (i.e. SuperCollider code snippets with less than 280 characters) were a thing as well.

Here's some of my own creations.

Also included is a file with a bunch of SC140 tweets that are not my own, but taken from [https://github.com/celesteh/sc140/](celesteh's sc140 repo).
