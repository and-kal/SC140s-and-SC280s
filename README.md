I love the idea of tweetable SuperCollider code which was popular for some time. 
They were called "SC140" - small SuperCollider patches with 140 max. 
You can find a lot of them through the [@sc140tweets](https://twitter.com/sc140tweets) account on Twitter still. Back in 2009, UK's the Wire magazine even did a compilation album with SC140s; the source code of its contributions can be found [here]().

Since I don't have a Twitter I share my SC140s here.

Also included is a file with some SC280s (i.e. SuperCollider code snippets with less than 280 characters) I created as well as a collection of SC140 tweets that are not my own creation, but taken from [https://github.com/celesteh/sc140/](celesteh's sc140 repo).
